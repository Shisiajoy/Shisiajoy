## Hi there 👋🏾


I am a data scientist with a strong foundation in health records and information management, enthusiastic about applying machine learning and data analysis to tackle real-world problems, particularly in the healthcare sector. 

Currently expanding my knowledge in deep learning and healthcare technologies and open to collaboration opportunities in tech, data science, machine learning and healthcare fields.
